ROR--2015--SPRING
=================
## Hello and Welcome to Ruby on Rails at The IronYard!

What you are reading right now is called a `README` file. Software projects will commonly have a file like this in the main directory for the project to explain what the project is and how to use it. `README`s are also often found inside major subdirectories of a project. Because these files are so common, and so useful, GitHub displays them whenever you navigate to a folder which has one (unlike, say, the `LICENSE` file, which you'd have to click to see).

This is the GitHub class project for the 2015 Spring Ruby on Rails course at The IronYard Orlando. Inside this project you'll notice a couple of directories. Please take some time to read through the `README` files in each. Throughout the course, I'll be adding files to this repository to distribute assignments, notes for each class, and general information about the course. Throughout the course, you'll open, close, and contribute to Issues and Pull Requests ([more about "issues" on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues)). If you have any questions about any of the content, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/ROR--2015--SPRING/issues), and I'll attempt to answer you promptly.

Thanks,
